# university-physics-6th

A personal project to compile an answer key for a popular physics textbook:

University Physics, 6th edition (1982)  
Francis W. Sears, Mark W. Zemansky, Hugh D. Young  
ISBN-13: 978-0201071955  
ISBN-10: 0201071959

My intention is to write a complete solutions manual ([pdf](./answer_key.pdf)),
for use by physics students, self-learners, and other physics enthusiasts.

This project is also a mechanism for me to actually learn LaTeX, and to improve 
my Mathematica skills.

Oh, and to learn a bit of physics, too.
