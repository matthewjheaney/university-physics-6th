# university-physics-6th

A personal project to compile an answer key for a popular physics textbook:

University Physics, 6th ed (1982)
Francis W. Sears, Mark W. Zemanski, Hugh D. Young
ISBN 0-201-07195-9

This project is also a mechanism for me to actually learn LaTex, to improve 
my Mathematica skills.

Oh, and to learn a bit of physics, too.
